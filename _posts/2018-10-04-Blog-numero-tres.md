What did I do

Today we learned how to create a code that, after inserting different numbers into our code, we will be able to have any different code combos. My immediate reaction to this was " What if i was to insert a random number picker, then would we have a random code?" As a matter of fact we would, we would have a random code for any writing. We were also learning how to make the code infinite, for example originally we had only used HELLO WORLD to decode. However if we hadn't of changed the code and written MY NAME IS JOHN, then it wouldnâ€™t work. But by slightly changing the code we could use it with any length of writing. 

What did we learn?

Today we learned how to make an infinite code using only sheets. I found this quite difficult as it was very hard to understand the types of code. This was new to me but I finally understood how to do it. 

And onwards 

Next week I don't know how we could improve this and and make it better but no it will be trickier then this week.
