What did we do?

Today in computing science we learned how to use google sheets to encode a simply saying, for example hello world. We did this by using the command 'vlookup' which, in basic form, means vertical lookup allowing it to look above to the next square. We used this to allow us to change what the letter came out to be. This was simple however quite hard to remember so i made a note of it during the lesson. We had to figure out on our own how we shoulders and code it however i struggled a bit during that. This could then be used as a specified code called the Caesar cipher

What did I learn?

I learnt how to basically start to code using google sheets which seems to be impossible however it is not. I. Learned that using my past knowledge of encoding and mixing it with the knowledge of computer codes to make the coder on sheets. 

And onwardsâ€¦

Next week we are going to make an decoder using sheets which I think will be a lot harder than what we did this week as we have to reverse the whole code which might be tricky.
