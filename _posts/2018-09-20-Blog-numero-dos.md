What did we do?

This week we had a cover lesson as our teacher - Mr Tansley - wasn't in school. This meant that we had to go into Mr Keen’s classroom so that he could explain what we where going to do in the lesson. We were back on using google sheets to help us code things or decode them. Last week we were coding a message using the code =vlookup, so that we could code anything to be anything else, also known as a caesar cypher. This week we were looking to decode the coded message and then make it one string of letters. To do this we used the code concatinate. This then but it in a string of letters. 

What did I learn

I learned the code 'concatinate' and how to decade a coded message by adding a third column of letters. This can then be used for others things and other codes, so this is a useful code for future knowledge. 

And onwards…

Next week I think that we should be learning maybe another code such as the enigma code as this is another really useful code.
